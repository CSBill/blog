It's been over 2 years, since the development on SolidInvoice 2.0.0 has started, and today we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of version 2.0.0.

SolidInvoice 2.0.0 contains various new features, a lot of bug fixes and an updated UI. This post will highlight some of the most exciting changes in the latest version.
For the fill changelog, see [https://github.com/SolidInvoice/SolidInvoice/releases/tag/2.0.0](https://github.com/SolidInvoice/SolidInvoice/releases/tag/2.0.0)

### New modern UI

Since the initial version of SolidInvoice, we always aimed to provide a clean and user-friendly user interface.
In version 2, we revamped the user interface to be cleaner, modern and conform to most modern-day best practices. The new user-interface is very intuitive and have a fresh new feel to it.
This will assist users in navigating the application easier and make common actions look and feel very natural. 

### PDF Invoices and Quotes

When creating quotes and invoices, we now generate a PDF version which is automatically attached to the standard outgoing email. You also now have the option to download a PDF from the invoice/quote view page.
This makes sending and sharing quotes and invoices easier, and your clients don't have to struggle to view quotes and invoices in their email client.
 
### Multi-user support

Now you can create additional users that can log into the application to manage clients or create quotes and invoices.
This makes it easier for companies with multiple staff members that manages the billing, so each member can have their own login credentials.

### Support for multiple databases

Previously SolidInvoice was limited to MySQL databases. In version 2, we added support for more databases.
Now you can install SolidInvoice using a Postgresql, Oracle, SQL Server and various other databases.

### New API

We changed the core framework for the API, which allows us to create a more powerful API. This allows for better integration into other applications.

### Platform changes

A new version always gives the opportunity to change the platform and core requirements. In SolidInvoice version 2, we updated the core platform to allow us to stay up to date with the technologies we use and also ensure we include all the available security and big fixes from the underlying platform.
