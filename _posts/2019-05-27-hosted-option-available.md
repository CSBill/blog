SolidInvoice is, and always will be, free and open-source software. This means that you can download and install it on your own servers, and use it free forever.
But we also recognize that some users don't have their own servers available, or don't want to go through the trouble of managing their own infrastructure.

Therefore, we are pleased to announce that SolidInvoice now has a hosted option available. This means you can get an instance of SolidInvoice up and running withing a few minutes without having to worry about infrastructure or servers.

The hosted option of SolidInvoice includes the exact same features as the open-source version, with unlimited usage and a couple of additional benefits outlined below.

### Benefits of the hosted option

Choosing the hosted option gives you more than just an instantly available running instance of SolidInvoice.

Some of the additional benefits of the hosted option includes

#### Guaranteed Email delivery

When opting to host SolidInvoice yourself, one of the requirements is a way to send emails so that you can get your invoices to your clients.
This option can either be a hosted SMTP server, managing your own SMTP server, setting up Sendmail on the server or using your Gmail account.

The hosted solution takes care of this requirement for you, so that you are guaranteed that your invoices always ends up in your clients inbox, and it is one less piece of infrastructure that you need to worry about.

There can be nothing worse than a server that crashes and losing months of valuable information. That is why backups are an essential part of any running software application.
