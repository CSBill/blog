We are pleased to announce that the immediate availability of Release 0.5.0.

This is another big releases, and includes various new features, a lot of bug fixes and new email templates.

This release also includes a new RESTful API, with limited support to create, manage and delete clients, contacts, quotes and invoices.

We have also removed the dependency on the PHP intl extension. This means CSBill is available to a broader range of users and servers that don't necesarilly have the intl extension installed.
Without the intl extension, you will be limited to only the "en" locale. If you want to use other locales, then you need to enable the intl extension.
