CSBill finally has it's own logo!

You can see the new logo in the top-left corner of this page, and it is also available on all the CSBill sites (website, application, github, twitter, docs, blog etc) and also used as the favicon for all the sites.

This is part of a new branding process that CSBill is undergoing.

Stay tuned in the coming months where we will start to reveal more detail of the new brand, and also update all the sites to match one brand.
