We are also getting close to releasing the first stable 1.0.0 release. As it currently stands, we might still do an 0.8 release, then start with RC releases for 1.0.0.

If there are any issues that needs to be fixed, or features you would like to see in the 1.0.0 release, please let us know, since the 0.8 will be our last feature-release.
After the 0.8 release, we will enter a feature-freeze, where only bugs will be fixed, and all new features will be postponed until the 1.1.0 release.
