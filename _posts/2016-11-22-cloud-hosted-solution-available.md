CSBill now offers a cloud-hosted solution. If you can't host CSBill on your own server, then you can sign-up for a cloud-based instance.

The benefits of using the cloud-hosted solution, is that you don't have to worry about any server maintenance, high availability, backups or system updates.
The cloud-hosted option includes weekly backups, so you don't have to worry about losing data or storing backups. It also comes with automatic updates.
If a new version of CSBill is released, you will be among the first to get the new features, without the worry of having to do any manual updates.

CSBill is still a free and open-source application, and you can still download and host it for free on your own server. That won't change. But the cloud-hosted option
provides the ability for companies to get a billing option quickly without any effort. The hosted option also offers premium support, where the open-source version depends on support from the community. 

The hosted option is only $10 per month, with no limits. You can create unlimited clients, and send unlimited quotes and invoices.
There is no fair usage policy, no restrictions, no limits. You get all the great features of CSBill, in the cloud!
All plans comes with a free 14 day trial, so you can try the service with no obligation. No credit card is needed during the trial

Head over to [https://csbill.io](https://csbill.io/?utm_source=blog&utm_campaign=notification&utm_medium=post) now to sign up for a free 14 day trial.
