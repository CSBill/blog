In our previous blog post, we mentioned that we will soon move our repository to a new location.

That day has come.

This morning we have moved the repository to the n ew location at (https://github.com/CSBill/CSBill)

This change won't affect anybode much, as Ghithub recently introduced Repository Redirects.
So everything should continue to work as normal.

Some more changes that we are planning to make soon, is to split every bundle into it's own seperate repository,
so it will be easier to focus development on specific parts of the application in their own repository.
